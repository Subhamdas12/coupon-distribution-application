1.Coupon Listing

Partner stores submit exclusive coupons with details (discount, validity, terms).

Coupons are displayed on the platform for users to browse.

2.User Requests

Users request coupons they’re interested in (no immediate claim).

Requests are added to a round-robin queue for fair distribution.

3.Waiting Period

Users wait until the coupon expires (no first-come-first-serve rush).

System tracks request order and coupon availability.

4.Automatic Distribution

After expiration, the system distributes coupons sequentially to all requesters.

Each user gets a turn in the queue until all coupons are allocated.

5.Fair Usage Rules

One request per hour to prevent abuse.

Coupons are non-transferable (tied to the user’s account).

Unclaimed coupons are reassigned to others.
